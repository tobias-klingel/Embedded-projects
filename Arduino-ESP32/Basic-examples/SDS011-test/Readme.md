# SDS011 particle sensor with ESP32 in Arduino

## Introduction

This project is for testing purpose and provides a working example to read out the fine dust sensor SDS011. This sensor measures PM 2.5 and PM 10 air particle count in Î¼g/m3. 

### Usage

Just compile and upload the ".ino" file to the board, connect the sensor as shown below and the data shall be shown in the serial terminal.
