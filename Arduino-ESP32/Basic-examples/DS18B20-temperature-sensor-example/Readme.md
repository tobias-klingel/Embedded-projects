# Temperature sensor DS18B20 with ESP32 from TTGO

### Introduction

This project is for testing purpose and provides a working example to measure the temperature by using a DS18B20 temperature sensor which works via the Dallasâ€™ 1-Wire bus. Several sensors are able to use the same wire for communication. See the schematic below.

### Usage

Just compile and upload the ".ino" file to the board, connect the sensors and very important the 4.7K Ohm resistor as stated below.
